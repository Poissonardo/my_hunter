In this game you should click on the nyan cats that fall from the sky with grace (they are
animated and deleted when clicked). The difficulty increases slowly as time passes, highscores are saved and displayed
along current used score. The controls are simple, you point to where you want to aim and then click on what you want to shoot at
(nyan cats). The center of the crossair is represented by Flavio's fingers pinching.
